# Demonstration Design

This section details the entirety of the design for the demonstration level of the game, which will be used to demonstrate the game mechanics, art style, theme and atmosphere, music, and ambience.

*Italic text indicates the possibility that an element may already be present throughout the entirety of the demostration. For example, a unique item or ability that the player already has.*
**Bold text indicates the possibility that an element may be present some time during the demonstration. For example, a unique item or ability that is acquired within the demonstration level.**
Unformatted text indicates the possibility that an element may already be present or present some time later in the game, but not in the demonstration. For example, a unique item or ability that the player may acquire some other time during the game.

As with all levels within the game, the demonstration level will contain each of the following:

* Raw puzzles (they do not require the involvement of unique items in order to complete them.)
* Unique puzzles (they do require the involvement of unique items in order to complete them.)
* A collection of enemies with unique traits (at least 3 different unique enemies; a maximum of 6.)
* A miniboss with an acquireable ability / unique item which is obtained upon defeating it.
* A boss which must be defeated by using one or more unique items, including the unique item obtained within the level.
* A non-equipment item which has some involvement with the game story.

Each of these elements are expanded on below for the purpose of the demonstration level. A document similar to this may be made in the future for the design of further levels within the game. This level may not make an appearance within the final game; should it, it may make an appearance further in the game. Some game mechanics present during the demonstration may not be available at the start of the game and may be acquired in previous levels.

## Raw puzzles

Raw puzzles are puzzles that do not require the usage of unique items or abilities found throughout the game. Several examples of these puzzles are listed below, and may be present within the demonstration level:

* Switches that must be activated in order, so that an event will occur which provides further progression, i.e. a door unlocks.
* Objects that must be placed in a particular order, ^
* Several switches must be activated in a short timeframe, ^
* All enemies within a room must be defeated, ^
* Doors which require a non-unique item in order to be unlocked, such as a key.
* Doors which automatically close unless reached before a certain time.

## Unique puzzles

Unique puzzles act similarly to raw puzzles, but require the usage of unique items in order to complete them. Several examples are listed below:

* *An unreachable (across a hole) switch that must be activated, so that an event will occur which provides further progression, i.e. a door unlocks.*
    - *Can be reached using Lightstep, an ability to allow short-ranged teleportation.*
* **An object that requires light to be powered, ^**
    - **Possible unique item required: Light chain, a chain which can hook on to hookable tiles. It can be used to retrieve and hold a single light fragment. Light fragments are used to give light to Lightstones. They also damage enemies of pure darkness.**

## Unique enemies

* **An enemy with a high defense but low offense. Their weak spots are usually their backs. The light chain can be used to remove their front defense.**
* **An enemy which remains hidden in shadows, and is revealed when exposed to light.**
* *An enemy with good reflexes, a shield and average offense. They have extremely high defense but can be defeated using Lightstep to get behind them.*
* *An enemy with a close-range self-defense mechanism. This can be countered by attacking quickly or from a longer range.*
* An enemy using long-ranged weaponry such as a bow and arrow or a short-life energy beam.
* An enemy which stuns the player, either disabling them entirely or disabling certain abilities.
* An enemy which can teleport and use other magicks.
* An enemy which can drain the player's life.

## Miniboss

The demonstration miniboss uses the light chain to make it harder for the player to see where he is, by reducing the light in the room and reducing the player's line of sight. They also use the light chain to hook onto hookable tiles in the room, but only when the room is lit. The miniboss also uses a sword.

## Boss

The demonstration boss is a being of pure darkness, which cannot be attacked using the sword alone. The player must acquire a Light fragment and use the light chain to launch it at the boss' weak spot, stunning him and allowing his armor to be pulled off. When all of the armor is removed, he becomes faster but weaker, and uses a different move set.
