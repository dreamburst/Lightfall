# Lightfall

## Game Design

### Summary

The hero is a descendent of the Aetherian guardian, protector of the Aethosphere, a vessel which gives light to the world.  The villain tampers with the Aethosphere, causing it to shatter, thus sending the world into darkness.  The hero must collect the light shards, the fragments of the Aethosphere that were cast around the world, and restore the Aethosphere, as well as defeat the villain and put a stop to his reign of darkness.

### Gameplay

The goal of the game is to restore peace and light to the world.  The obstacles are puzzles the hero will encounter on his quest; the varying types of enemies with unique features; the minibosses, each with unique abilities the hero can yield and use to solve previously hindering puzzles and defeat the main boss who guards the light shard of that dungeon.

### Mindset

The hero is silent but valiant, and will not cower at the sight of enemies.  He will always sacrifice himself for anyone in danger without a second thought.  The hero is someone with a strong responsibility to those he seeks to protect, that almost anyone will look up to.  These aspects of the hero are shown throughout the game, and used to provide the player with a sense of justice and heroism.

## Technical

### Screens

#### Title Screen
A screen with a minimalistic user interface. The only text visible is "Press Any Button", which will start a new game or continue a previously played game. There is no "How To Play" or "Instructions". The game aims to teach the player by letting them play and learn by doing so. The player can access the options menu from this screen.

#### Pause Screen
A simple screen which pauses the game and adds an overlay screen containing three options:
  - Game Options
    * Video Options
    * Audio Options
    * Erase Save Data
  - Exit Game to Title Screen
  - Exit Game to Desktop

#### Game Screen
The Game Screen contains the playable area, a toggleable inventory overlay and a player status overlay.

### Mechanics

#### NATIVE PLAYER MECHANICS

##### Sprinting
Sprinting acts similarly to the mountain buke in Pok√©mon, whereby the hero gains speed but loses control when coming to a stop. Unless mastered, this can cause the hero to take damage by falling off the edge of a cliff.

##### Swordsmanship
The hero wields a blade which can be used to quickly slice at enemies, or, if in focus stance, deal increased damage to all enemies within reach. Additional swordsman skills can be learnt.

##### Basic Environment Interaction
The hero is able to press basic buttons and switches, talk to NPCs, and open doors and chests.

#### ACQUIRED PLAYER MECHANICS

##### Lightstep
Lightstep allows the hero to teleport a short distance, over small holes or through void walls.

##### Hookchain
The Hookchain allows the hero to pull towards anything the chain is attached to. If attached to another entity, depending on its' size, it will be brought towards the player.

#### GAME MECHANICS

##### Moving Platforms
Automatic and switch-activated platforms.

##### Twilit Gateways
Doors that are opened by striking the keyhole with a Twilit Keyblade, the boss key of a dungeon.

##### Void Walls
Void Walls are walls of darkness that cannot be passed by matter. They can be teleported through using Lightstep.
